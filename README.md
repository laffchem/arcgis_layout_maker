## Instructions

You can edit these commands to your own project, but this essentially something I wrote for myself to quickly make map layouts that I repetetively do throughout the work week.

It asks you the scale that you want to use, best practice for engineering is to make sure the number is divisible by whatever measurement system you're using. Since I'm in the US and everyone uses feet for engineering requests, my scale is divisible by 12. Otherwise with metric it should be 10.

Other than that, customize it to whatever fits your work flow.
